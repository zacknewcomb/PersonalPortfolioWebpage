		<h2>About Me</h2>
    
		<p>Graduate student at Ohio University, pursuing a master's degree in degree in mathematics. I graduated from the University of Kentucky in May 2020 with a bachelor's degree in mathematics, along with a minor in computer science. Aside from learning web development, I am interested in software engineering, data science, quality assurance, machine learning, and applied and numerical analysis.
		</p>
    
		<p>I am currently a teaching assistant at Ohio University. I returned to Dynetics for the summer of 2020. In my last semester at the University of Kentucky, I was a grading TA for MA/CS 321 taught by Dr. Greg Wasilkowski. I was a software engineering intern at Dynetics for the summer of 2019. I interned for ClassCalc as a QA Engineering Intern in the summer of 2018. I concluded an internship with SaRA: Simplifying Recovery Assistant, working on their development team in the spring of 2018.</p>

    <div id ="Portfolio">
    <h2>Portfolio</h2>
      
    <p>This is my current portfolio, and new projects are added and updated regularly! I am constantly working on Python, C++, and web development projects.</p>

      <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/zacknewcomb/ScientificComputation">Scientific Computation Package</a> 
	</div>
  
    <div id="project-description">
      <p>This features a suite of scientific computing applications, coded in Python, used to solve ODEs, solve common linear algebra problems, find roots of real valued functions, and more. It features select algorithms proposed in recent numerical analysis research papers, along with more classic numerical methods. </p>

      <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/zacknewcomb/PACMAN-AI"> PACMAN Artificial Intelligence</a>
    </div>
         
    <div id="project-description">
      <p>This was built using Python, allows PACMAN to find food anywhere in a maze. This was done by implementing Breadth First, Depth First, Uniform Cost, and A* search algorithms. I utilized heuristic functions to minimize the nodes expanded when search through the maze to find the food</p>

      <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/zacknewcomb/SpaceShooter">Space Shooter</a>
    </div>
         
    <div id="project-description">
      <p>A replica of the popular 1980's fixed shooter game, Galaga. Implemented using JavaScript, this top down scrolling shooter game is played in a web browser. It records your score, enemies spawned, enemies defeated, and time you stayed alive.</p>

      <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/zacknewcomb/BBallTeamProj">Basketball Stat Keeping Project</a>
    </div>
    <div id="project-description">
      <p>This project was written in C++. The program reads in a .txt file and that data is what is used in the program. You can add games, display individual players or the whole team, delete players, and sort by jersey and name. When the program is closed, it writes another .txt file with the final assorment of players and stats.</p>
