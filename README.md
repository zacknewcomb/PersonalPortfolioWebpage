# Personal Portfolio Webpage

This is my personal portfolio webpage. It utilizies bootstrap, HTML, and CSS. It lists my most recent projects, along with my education and career background. This is for anyone who is looking for how to connect with me, gain an understanding of my background, or look into my projects. You can save the .html and .css files and open the project in your favorite browser to see the webpage.

This website is not hosted anywhere, but rather available on my codepen. You can access it [here](https://codepen.io/zacknewcomb/full/rpwxZP/)
