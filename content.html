    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Undergraduate student at the University of Kentucky, pursuing a bachelor's degree in degree in mathematics and a minor in computer science. I will be graduating in May 2020. Along with learning web development, I am interested in software engineering, data science, quality assurance, machine learning, and applied and numerical analysis.
    </p>
    
    <p>I am applying to a number of graduate schools. I am interested in Applied Mathematics and Computational Mathematics programs.
    </p>
    
    <p>I am currently a grading TA for MA/CS 321 taught by Dr. Greg Wasilkowski . I was software engineering intern at Dynetics for the summer of 2019. I interned for ClassCalc as a QA Engineering Intern in the summer of 2018. I concluded an internship with SaRA: Simplifying Recovery Assistant, working on their development team in the spring of 2018.</p>

    <h2>Portfolio</h2>
    <p>This is my current portfolio, and new projects are added regularly! I am constantly working on Python, C++, and web development projects.</p>

      <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/zacknewcomb/PACMAN-AI"> PACMAN Artificial Intelligence</a>
    </div>
         
    <div id="project-description">
      <p>This was built using Python, allows PACMAN to find food anywhere in a maze. This was done by implementing Breadth First, Depth First, Uniform Cost, and A* search algorithms. I utilized heuristic function to minimize the nodes expanded when search through the maze to find the food</p>

      <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/zacknewcomb/LinearAlgebra">Linear Algebra Suite</a> 
  </div>
  
    <div id="project-description">
      <p>This features a suite of linear algebra applications, coded in Python, used to solve common computational linear algebra problems. Includes scripts that can compute matrix multiplication, dot product, cross product, etc.</p>

      <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/zacknewcomb/BBallTeamProj">Basketball Stat Keeping Project</a>
       </div>
    <div id="project-description">
      <p>This project was written in C++. The program reads in a .txt file and that data is what is used in the program. You can add games, display individual players or the whole team, delete players, and sort by jersye and name. When the program is closed, it writes another .txt file with the final assorment of players and stats.</p>
